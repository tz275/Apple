And to help people discover apps they love, the team uses machine learning techniques that include natural language processing to develop new algorithms for personalization, search, and recommender systems. \n\nIn a world where apps have become essential in people\u2019s daily lives, the App Store team has become essential to Apple\u2019s business."}, "200466832": {"jobID": "200466832", "origin_search": null, "posted": "Mar 1, 2023", "jobTitle": "AIML - Machine Learning Scientist, Siri & Information Intelligence (SII)", "companyName": "Apple", "link": "https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200466832/aiml-machine-learning-scientist-siri-information-intelligence-sii?team=MLAI", "jobLocation": {"remote": "not specified", "city": "Seattle", "state": null, "country": "US"}, "educationRequirement": {"education": "bachelors | masters", "major": "Bachelors, Masters, or Ph.D degree in a related field, or equivalent experience"}, "jobType": {"internship": false, "partTime": false, "fullTime": true, "coop": false, "contract": false, "independent_contractor": false, "temporary": false, "oncall": false, "volunteer": "False"}, "visaSponsorship": {"none": true, "cpt_opt": true, "h1b": true, "eb": true}, "salary": {"min": "$115,000", "max": "$217,500,"}, "benefits": null, "requirements": "Industry experience in one or more of the following areas: natural language processing, large language modeling, model compression and on-device machine learningExtensive experience from experimentation and prototyping to deployment into production pipelinesProficient programming skills in Python and one of the deep learning toolkits such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or JaxMeticulous attention to detail and dedication to quality; Excellent written and oral communication skills on both technical and non-technical topicsBachelors, Masters, or Ph.D degree in a related field, or equivalent experiencePublications in top conferences are a plus", "jobDescription": "We are a group of engineers and researchers responsible for the personalization and discovery intelligence in the Siri & Information Intelligence (SII) organization at Apple.
